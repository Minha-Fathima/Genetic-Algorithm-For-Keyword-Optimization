# Genetic-Algorithm-For-Keyword-Optimization

This project is a learning exercise where I am exploring and implementing **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to optimize **keyword selection** for improved search performance.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to use a Genetic Algorithm to intelligently evolve a set of keywords that can perform better in terms of search visibility, engagement, or other performance metrics.

## 📖 Learning Source

This implementation is inspired by the article by **Ali Owji**:

I'm following the concepts described in the article, experimenting with Python, and using libraries like `DEAP`, `NumPy`, and `Pandas`.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.12
- [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) — Genetic Algorithms framework
- NumPy
- Pandas
